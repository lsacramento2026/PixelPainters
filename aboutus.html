                <h4>Clark Div Chan</h4>
                <p>HI hi, I'm Clark. I did some JavaScript stuff but I mostly worked on fixing the errors in the code. I was obsessed with J-pop, but now I'm more into musicals and stuff. I love cramming while listening to songs that would further slow my progress.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Aya Mateo</h4>
                <p>'Sup, I'm Aya. I designed all the graphics as well as helped with both the CSS and Javascript. When I'm not thinking about acads, I'm usually obsessing over some fictional character, like Wylan Van Eck from Six of Crows. Anyway, I had fun doing this project and I'm quite proud of our game!</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Lucas Miguel Sacramento</h4>
                <p>Hi! I'm Lucas. I worked on most of the javascript, and the CSS. Outside of coding, I enjoy videogames such as Genshin Impact and Valorant. Doing some game dev, even as simple as this one, was a really fun experience. I hope to do something like it again soon!</p>
