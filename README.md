# PixelPainters (work in progress title?)

to do: 
- menu page! (pixel font, level select, aesthetic to fit the images)
- a bunch of levels
- figure out how grids work, how to color select, zooming in and out

general flow:
first page is the menu, with a built in level select already
a modal (or something?) that asks you if you want a tutorial that takes you to an easy image
level selected
brings user to the page
??
level complete page
go back to menu
Repeat
