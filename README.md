# PixelPainters (work in progress title?)

to do: 
- menu page! (pixel font, level select, aesthetic to fit the images)
- a bunch of levels
- figure out how grids work, how to color select, zooming in and out (solved)
- make different webpages per level, add transitions between them

general flow:
- first page is the menu, with a built in level select already
- after user selects level it brings u to that page
- level selected
- actual paint by numbers
- ??
- level complete page (prolly a modal that asks if you wanna go to the next level, restart, or menu)
- Repeat

design and theme:
(possible thoughts lng to, feel free to suggest)
- pastel colors? cutesy stuff idk
- cold blue tones and darker colors

additional things
current files are placeholders, just copy and paste the actual webpages when finished. due tuesday so we gotta work on this stuff asap.
